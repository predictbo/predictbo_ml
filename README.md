PredictBo is a web application designed to predict Oil Formation Volume Factor (Bo). Bo is a critical parameter for oil and gas reservoir calculations. 
To address challenges in estimating Bo, I developed PredictBo, leveraging machine learning and neural networks to provide an alternative to traditional empirical methods.

Key Features of PredictBo

âœ… Model: Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on four essential features:
 â€¢ Bubble Point Pressure
 â€¢ Temperature
 â€¢ Solution Gas-Oil Ratio
 â€¢ API Gravity
âœ… Dataset: 221 experimental data points combined with Rashidi et al. 591 data points
âœ… Performance Metrics:
 â€¢ R-squared: 95.46% (testing set)
 â€¢ Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0026
 â€¢ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0347

Innovations in Development

ðŸ”¹ Discretization
ðŸ”¹ Regularization
ðŸ”¹ Adam Optimization and Callbacks

I intend to improve upon the project with more extensive data and experiment with other techniques to achieve even greater accuracy and reliability.

ðŸ’¡ I welcome feedback and suggestions to further enhance this project.
